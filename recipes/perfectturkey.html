    <p>Moist turkey, perfect for the holiday season</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole turkey, neck and gibletts removed</li>
        <li>2 Cups Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>4 carrots, coarsely chopped, divided</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme, divided</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <p><li>Rub turkey inside and out with kosher salt; 
            place in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Cover and refrigerate 
            to allow turkey to soak in brine solution for 12 hours, or overnight.</li></p>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the 
            turkey; discard the brine mixture.</li></p>
        <p><li>Brush turkey with 1/2 of the melted butter. Place breast-side down on a 
            roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff turkey cavity with 1/2 the 
            onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and bay leaf. Scatter 
            remaining vegetables and thyme in the bottom of the roasting pan; 
            pour white wine over vegetables.</li></p>
        <p><li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink at the 
            bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully turn turkey 
            breast-side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with remaining butter. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone,
            should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li></p>
        <p><li>Allow turkey to rest 30 minutes before carving</li></p>
    
    </ol></p>
